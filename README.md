# msfs-bindings

Export Microsoft Flight Simulator Key and Joystick bindings to csv files.


Set remotePath in appsettings.json to the directory where the inputprofile files are :

For the Steam version, that is something like :

```
"remotePath": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\userdata\\178533733\\1250410\\remote"
```

For the MS store version, that is something like (unable to verify):

```
"remotePath": "C:\\Users\\YOURUSERNAME\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\Microsoft.FlightSimulator_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\SystemAppData\\wgs"
```
